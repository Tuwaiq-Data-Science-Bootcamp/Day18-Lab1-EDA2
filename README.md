 ## Logistic regression
 Regression analysis is a type of predictive modeling technique used to find the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
 
 Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on given dataset of independent variables. This algorithm can help predict the likelihood of events by looking at historical data points. It also can be defined as a classification algorithm that
 predicts a binary outcome based on a series of independent variables. It’s applied to predict categorical variable as yes and no, or in our case positive and negative.
 It is considered one of the most common binary classification algorithms in machine learning and data science. Which means it has proven its sufficiency throughout the machine learning history.
